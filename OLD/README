First of all make sure that ND280 Software is installed and the environment is loaded (source Run_At_Start_T2K.sh and nd280upgrade.sh)

go to t2k-nd280-upgrade-master and do:

source nd280upgrade.sh $PWD

1.) To build the code do:

cd $ND280UPGRADEPATH/build
cmake ../src/
make

2.) Additional building options can be added by passing extra -D command line arguments to CMake.
    The available options are listed below:

 * _USE_CPP11 : Set to "ON" to enable c++11 support.

 * _MY_ND280MC_INCLUDE_DIR : Full path to the include files of a stand-alone (customized) version of the nd280mc package.

 * _MY_ND280MC_LIBRARY_DIR : Full path to the library file of a stand-alone (customized) version of the nd280mc package.

 * _MY_OAEVENT_INCLUDE_DIR : Full path to the include files of a stand-alone (customized) version of the oaEvent package.

 * _MY_OAEVENT_LIBRARY_DIR : Full path to the library file of a stand-alone (customized) version of the oaEvent package.

 * _MY_INGRIDUTILS_INCLUDE_DIR : Full path to the include files of a stand-alone (customized) version of the ingridUtils package.

 * _MY_INGRIDUTILS_LIBRARY_DIR : Full path to the library file of a stand-alone (customized) version of the ingridUtils package.

 example:

cmake -D_MY_ND280MC_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/yordan/T2K/work/nd280mc-up/src/ \
      -D_MY_ND280MC_LIBRARY_DIR=/home/yordan/T2K/work/nd280mc-up/lib/ \
      -D_USE_CPP11=ON \
      ../src/


3.) To run the code do:

cd $ND280UPGRADEPATH/bin
./ND280Upgrade.exe ../src/app/ND280Upgrade/vis.mac (or any other input file)


/////////////

In order to add packages to be compiled you need to:

1)

open  $ND280UPGRADEPATH/src/CMakeLists.txt and add (or replace)

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../src/app/PATH_TO_INCLUDE) ### header files

open  $ND280UPGRADEPATH/src/app/CMakeLists.txt and add (or replace)

AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY(ND280Upgrade/src sourcefile) ###

ADD_EXECUTABLE(ND280Upgrade.exe          ND280Upgrade/Main.cc ${sourcefile}) ###

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(ND280Upgrade.exe   ${ROOT_LIBRARIES}
                                         ${GEANT4_LIBRARIES}
                                         ${INGRIDUTILS_LIBRARIES}
                                         ${OAEVENT_LIBRARIES}
                                         ${ND280MC_LIBRARIES}
                                         )
