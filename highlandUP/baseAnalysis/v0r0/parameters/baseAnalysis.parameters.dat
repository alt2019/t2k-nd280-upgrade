Whether to initialize trees or not at the beginning of ach configuration

 < baseAnalysis.InitializeTrees = 1 >	

--- RooTrackerVtxTree ------------

 < baseAnalysis.SaveRooTrackerVtxTree = 1 >	

 --- Productions ------------

This parameter allows selecting production (FOR CORRECTIONS, BUNCHING AND SYSTEMATICS). 
 
 0 --> Select the production automatically base on the input file software version
 5 --> Production 5
 6 --> Production 6

 < baseAnalysis.Bunching.Production    = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.Production = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.Production = 0 >

 --- Cuts ------------

Enable/disable the beam quality cut when doing the "event_quality" cut.
This is useful when you are using oaAnalysis files that you processed yourself, and so
don't contain the beam data quality information. 
BY DEFAULT THIS SHOULD BE SET TO 1
 < baseAnalysis.EnableBeamQualityCut = 1 >
 
Enable/disable the ND280 data quality cut when doing the "event_quality" cut.
This is useful when you are using oaAnalysis files that you processed yourself, and so
don't contain the data data quality information. 
BY DEFAULT THIS SHOULD BE SET TO 1
 < baseAnalysis.EnableDataQualityCut = 1 >


 --- Corrections ------------

Disables all corrections regardless of the ones enabled below

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.DisableAllCorrections  = 0 >

Apply all corrections even if they were already applied in the input file

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.ForceApplyCorrections  = 0 >

Enable/Disable individual corrections

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableIgnoreRightECal   = 1 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableCT4POT            = 1 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableDQ                = 1 >

--- Event Weights ------------

Enable/disable configurations with a single systematic (when EnableSingleWeightSystConfigurations = 1)
and enable systematics in the "all_syst" configuration (when EnableAllSystematics = 1)

 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableSIPion            = 0 >	
 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableSIProton          = 0 >	

 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFluxNeutrino      = 0 >	
 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFluxAntiNeutrino  = 0 >	

--- Systematics ------------

Number of toy experiments
 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.NumberOfToys = 100 >

The Random Seed. When throwing toys we want the same random numbers for all jobs. Thus, the random seed should be the same in all cases (and different from 0 !!!!)

     0 --> A pure random seed is generated based on time
 not 0 --> A fix random seed is used 

 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.RandomSeed = 1 >

Use a different random generator for each systematic

 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.IndividualRandomGenerator = 0 >


--- Configurations ------------

Create configurations with a single systematic ( a configuration for each systematic selected above)

 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableSingleVariationSystConfigurations = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableSingleWeightSystConfigurations    = 0 >

Enable/disable the configuration with all systematics (or the ones selected above)

 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableAllSystematics = 1 >
